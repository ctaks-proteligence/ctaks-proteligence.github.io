For Tae's demos, do the following on AWS ~40 minutes before the demo:

1.  Start server "demo - PERSISTENT - WAS 8.5"
2.  Assign the Elastic IP to this server (demo.proteligence.com resolves
    to this IP; contact Mark for changes/problems with the mapping)
3.  Start server "demo - PERSISTENT - WAS 8.5 - latest"
4.  Send Tae the link to Datanet on the server, such as:
    <http://ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com:9080/datanet/>
5.  When Tae says he is done with the demo, stop both servers
