# Proteligence Wiki

This wiki is built using Github Pages with the Jekyll workflow.
This wiki uses the [git-wiki-theme](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme) by Drassil to achieve that coveted wiki look.

When the wiki is edited, it takes less than a minute for it to be recompiled with Jekyll and the changes to be updated on the deployed website.
However, should one wish to edit and view changes locally, there exists a way with Jekyll to compile and view it locally. Here are the [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
